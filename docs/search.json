    "text": "1. How large is the market for loans in Kenya?\nAn estimated 76 million loans in Kenya were taken by borrowers in 2021.1. Over half of these loans (54%) were mobile money overdrafts using M-PESA’s Fuliza service, and a further 12 percent were digital loans from mobile banking services (11%) or fintech apps (1%) (Figure 1). Social networks (friends, family and neihbors) accounted for 20% of loans disbursed, while other informal sources such as Chamas (voluntary savings or investment groups), shopkeepers, employers or buyers collectively contributed around 10%. The big picture that the data highlights is that that two-thirds of the demand for cash loans (by volume) in Kenya in 2021 was mediated through digital technologies, 30% was mediated through informal or relational agreements and 5% was mediated through traditional loan contracts at a financial institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The market for loans by volume\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, the total volume of loans disbursed in Kenya decreased by 10%, from 83.1 million to 75.8 million. Digital loans remained the dominant form of borrowing, though their share declined from 74% (61.2 million) in 2019 to 66% (50 million) in 2021. The use of social networks for borrowing increased significantly, rising from 13% (10.3 million) in 2019 to 21% (15.5 million) in 2021. The volume of traditional loans from financial institutions (Banks, Saccos, MFIs) fell by nearly 1 million and their market share fell from 4% to 3%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The market for loans by volume, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 breaks the total volume of loans disbursed by both the source of the loan and the borrower’s household wealth 2. Between 2019 and 2021, while the total volume of loans used by borrowers in the middle 40% and upper 20% of the household wealth distribution remained steady, the volume of loans used by borrowers in the poorest 40% of the distribution fell by 30% (from 22.4 million to 16.1 million loans). The drop is a result of significantly lower disbursements to poorer borrowers from digital lending services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The market for loans by volume and borrower’s household wealth, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of KSh 978 billion was disbursed by lenders in 2021 (Figure 4). Banks were the largest source, disbursing KSh 340.4 billion (35%), followed by Sacco/MFIs at KSh 263.35 billion (27%). Digital loans, including mobile banking, Fuliza and lending apps, accounted for a combined value of KSh 113 billion (12%), while informal lenders including social network, chama and shopkeeper loans accounted for KSh 186 billion (20%). The market for loans from a value perspective, is the mirror image of the volume perspective. Lending mediated through in-person agreements at formal financial institutions, while accounting for less then 5% of the volume, accounts for over two thirds of the total value of lending. Digital loans, while accounting for two-thirds of the volume accounts for 12% of the total value of lending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The market for loans by value, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to 2019, the total value of loans disbursed in 2021 fell by 30% (from KSh 1,420.5 to KSh 978 billion) (Figure 5). Much of this decline is attributable to Bank lending which fell by over KSh 300 billion (from KSh 690 to 340 billion) and Sacco lending which fell by nearly KSh 100 billion. Loans from social networks partially offset this decline, which increased from KSh 80 billion (6% of the total) in 2019 to KSh 113 billion (12%) in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The market for loans by value, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 breaks the total value of loans disbursed by both the source of the loan and the borrower’s household wealth and shows that the majority of the decline in the value of loan disbursements resulted from less credit flowing to borrowers in households ranking in the top 20% of the wealth distribution. The total value of Bank, Sacco and digital loans channeled to these wealthier borrowers collapsed by around 50% (from KSh 908 to Ksh 463 billion) between 2019 and 2021, while loans from friends and family rose by 50% (from KSh 33 to Ksh 50 billion). In contrast, the total value of loans disbursed to borrowers in households ranking the bottom 40% of the wealth distribution almost doubled, rising from KSh 56.1 billion in 2019 to KSh 98.1 billion in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The market for loans by volume, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 reveals lending to business owners fell by 70%, from KSh 579 billion to KSh 184 billion between 2019 and 2021. This decline was overwhelmingly a result of bank lending to business owners collapsing by 90 percent. Another factor contributes to the lower value of lending to businesses: the share of adults deriving most of their income from their business fell from 17 to 14% between 2019 and 2021 (among the wealthiest 20% of households, the share fell from 30 to 22%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The market for loans by volume, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 shows the distribution of loans by the amount borrowed (the loan principal) and the source of the loan for 2019 and 2021. A dominant majority of loans (nearly 60%) were less than KSh 2,500 in both 2019 and 2021, just over 20 percent were between KSh 2,500 and KSh 10,000 and 15 percent were between KSh 10,000 and KSh 50,000. Shopkeeper loans and digital loans dominate the market for small loans while formal, non-digital loans from Banks and Saccos dominate the market for large loans. Between 2019 and 2021, the distribution of loans shifted moderately to smaller loans as the share of loans greater than KSh 50,000 fell. In 2021, Fuliza accounted for nearly 1 in 3 loans less than KSh 2,500 and appears to be crowding out shopkeeper credit whose share fell from 33.6% of small loans (&lt; KSh 2,500) in 2019 to 23.4% of small loans in 2021 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Loans by size and source, 2019 and 2021"

    "text": "2. How prevalent are different forms of borrowing among adults?\nIn 2021, 56% of Kenyan adults were either currently borrowing or had attempted to borrow in the past year, with similar proportions for both men and women (Figure 9). Two-thirds of these borrowers used informal options such as social networks, chamas, private moneylenders, employers, or buyers to address their credit needs. Forty percent of this demand was satisfied by digital options, such as mobile banking, apps or Fuliza and 16 percent was met by traditional (non-digital) loans originating from financial institutions (commercial banks, SACCOs or MFIs). Between 2019 and 2021, the prevalence of bororwing increased from 52 to 56 percent, with digital lending sources driving this growing demand for borrowing.\nFuliza (M-Pesa’s mobile money overdraft service) saw a notable penetration into the credit market, with 18% of adults using it in 2021 (Figure 10). While the share of adults using loans from mobile banking services remained stable (9%), the share of adults borrowing from digital lending apps fell from 7% to 2% between 2019 and 2021. The share of adults borrowing from their social networks doubled from 8% to 16%. Overall, however, shopkeeper credit (including both cash loans and purchase of goods on credit) remained the most prevalent form of borrowing (30% of adults used shopkeeper credit in 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Prevalence of borrowing by source of loan and gender, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Prevalence of borrowing, by lender and gender, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 shows the share of borrowers in one of three mutually exclusive groups defined by the most formal loan used. In 2021, the most common type of borrower used loans exclusively from informal sources. For 38 percent of borrowers, digital loans are the only formal loan they use, one in five borrowers rely exclusively on digital loans to meet their financing needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Loan portfolio type, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, users of Fuliza borrowed an average of 7.2 times per year, significantly more frequently than borrowers from other lenders (Figure 12). Loans from social networks were the second most frequently used source, with an average of 3.4 loans per year, followed by mobile banking (2 loans), and Chama groups (1.9 loans). Other sources, such as fintech apps, private moneylenders, employers or buyers, and SACCOs/MFIs, averaged between 1.1 to 1.6 loans per year. This data underscores the high reliance on Fuliza for frequent, short-term credit needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Average number of loans taken per year among borrowers, 2021"

    "text": "3. Why do adults borrow?\nIn both 2019 and 2021, the primary reason for borrowing in Kenya was for basic consumption, with the poorest 40% of the population being the most frequent borrowers for this purpose (69% in 2019 and 62% in 2021) (Figure 13). The middle 40% and richest 20% also borrowed significantly for basic consumption, though to a slightly lesser extent. Educational expenses were the second most common reason for borrowing, with an increase between 2019 and 2021 evident among all wealth groups. Borrowing for business or farm investment decreased moderately between 2019 and 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Borrowers by main reason for taking loans by household wealth, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, borrowers in Kenya cited convenience and ease of obtaining a loan as the primary reasons for considering a lender their most important. Fuliza had the highest percentage of borrowers (60%) valuing convenience, followed by mobile banks (50%) and fintech apps (42%) (Figure 14). Affordability, in terms of low fees and repayments, was another significant factor, especially for SACCOs/MFIs (25%). Ease of use and the ability to make repayments were particularly important for borrowers from informal sources such as social networks (37%), shopkeepers (23%) and employers or buyers (32%), which likely appreciate the flexibility these lenders can afford. Features suited to individual needs, including privacy, were a key consideration for borrowers using fintech apps (34%) and personal or business loans from bank (31%). Trust is rarely cited as a reason people value a lender, with the highest being employer or buyer loans (12%). Overall, the data highlights that while convenience remains the predominant factor in lender importance, affordability and ease of repayments also play crucial roles in shaping borrower preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Loan features valued by borrowers, 2021"

    "text": "4. How many adults have difficulty repaying debt and why?\nBetween 2019 and 2021, the median loan size among borrowers increased from KSh 3,500 to KSh 4,000 and the percentage of adults with some outstanding debt rose from 40.6% to 49.5%. However, the median outstanding debt declined from KSh 2,700 in 2019 to KSh 2,000 in 2019, consistent with substantial rise in shorter-term loans, in particular Fuliza and shopkeeper credit. Total outstanding debt as a share of personal monthly income among borrowers remained at around 40% in 2019 and 2021 (Figure 15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Debt and delinquencies by lender, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, about 1 in 3 Kenyan adults were either having trouble repaying on time or in full (delinquent) or had to resort to adverse repayment strategies (such as reducing food expenditures, selling assets or borrowing more) (Figure 16). Overall the prevalence of debt stress rose between 2019 to 2021 from 31 to 34%, rising most sharply among the richest 20% of adults.\nIn 2019, 17.4 % of borrowers reported that they had defaulted at least once on a loan in the past year. In 2021, 58% of borrowers reported they had either “paid late, missed a payment, paid less or never paid” a loan in the past year (Figure 15). In 2021, the highest incidence of delinquent repayment behavior was associated with mobile banking loans (74%), social network loanss (64%) and apps (63%) while the lowest incidence of delinquent repayment behavior was associated with shopkeeper credit (21.%).\nIn 2021, “Using up all my money for basic needs” (46%) and “Did not plan well enought” (26%) were the two main reasons for failure to repay a loan on time and as agreed. Income declines and poor business performance were also signifant factors, particularly among adults in the highest income quintile. While the data for 2019 is not strictly consistent with 2021 as the reasons were collected for borrowers who reported defaulting on a loan, the patterns suggest the increasing role (from 2019 to 2021) of expenditure pressures forcing borrowers to prioritize basic consumption over debt repayment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Prevalence of debt stress and reasons for loan defaults and delinquency, 2019 and 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The market for loans by volume\nFigure 2: The market for loans by volume, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 3: The market for loans by volume and borrower’s household wealth, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 4: The market for loans by value, 2021\nFigure 5: The market for loans by value, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 6: The market for loans by volume, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 7: The market for loans by volume, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 8: Loans by size and source, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 9: Prevalence of borrowing by source of loan and gender, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 10: Prevalence of borrowing, by lender and gender, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 11: Loan portfolio type, 2021\nFigure 12: Average number of loans taken per year among borrowers, 2021\nFigure 13: Borrowers by main reason for taking loans by household wealth, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 14: Loan features valued by borrowers, 2021\nFigure 15: Debt and delinquencies by lender, 2019 and 2021\nFigure 16: Prevalence of debt stress and reasons for loan defaults and delinquency, 2019 and 2021"
